input random library

Define function 'czybije' which have to check if each of queens beats one another.
Nextly program checks with variables 'hetm1'and 'het2'in loop if some of queens aren't staying on fight positions.

Parallelly with function 'generuj' program generates a matrix with our queens, function 'append' adds position at the end of array;
Every line of matrix contains symbols"." and "H".
Then, 'random' ramdomly choose for index i and j place for "H" and "."
At the end, program shows us possible solving of Problems of Queens for inputted Natural Number

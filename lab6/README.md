
###Solving problem of linear programming
  lp = MixedIntegerLinearProgram(maximization=True)
Define the purpose function which contains three variables (x1, x2, x3)

Inputting parametres of A, b, c

Program finds the most opitmal sovling of problem depending on written (3, 8, 9) bounds

Program returns the result!

Voila!
